Hi my name is Maddi Sheetal Maddi. I have done my Bachelor's in Computer Science. I chose this course as I always wanted to make a career in developer department. I was always fascinated by technology and its development throughout my childhood and wanted to know more about it. I hope I learn a lot of new things and create a proper website from scratch by the end of this course.
